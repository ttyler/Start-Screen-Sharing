# Start-Screen-Sharing
Mac OS Allows for Screen Sharing, asking users to control their screen. Here is a way to turn that on.

Previously we have created processes to enable Apple's Remote Management Functionality, i.e. ARD, Apple Remote Management". a well documented script online is enableARD.sh However with customers moving towards non exposure of user data, using screen sharing allows the IT person to reuest access to a Mac, rather than simply control it.

This script was based on the Jamf framework but can easily be modififed for any delivery method.
